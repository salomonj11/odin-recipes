    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter
        </li>
        <li>1 onion, diced
        </li>
        <li>2 carrots, peeled and diced

        <li>2 1/2 pounds bone-in, skinless chicken breasts
        </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice, or more, to taste
        </li>

    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter in a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion, carrots and celery. Cook,
